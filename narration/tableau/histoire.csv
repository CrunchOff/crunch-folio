EXT. CITY STREET – TWILIGHT,"The city of Médiana is still awake, even as the sky darkens. A cool grey light covers the buildings.
","The streets are wet from earlier rain, and everything reflects—the lights, the movement, the colors.","Cars move slowly, one after another, filling the air with smoke and noise.","The sidewalk is cold and grey. People walk by in a hurry, their faces blurred, their steps fast.",,
,"The streets are full, but no one seems to see each other. Everyone is moving, but it’s hard to say where they’re going.
","O walks alone, like something is bothering him.","Around him, the city seems to shift. The edges of buildings bend a little. Lights flicker strangely.",It's like the world is slightly off—like a dream that doesn’t feel right.,,

",He unlocks the door and closes it behind him fast. He locks it again. Safe.,,,,

","O : ""It was really horrible, you know? I felt so bad, and I didn't even know why.""",He sits on the edge of his bed. His face softens a bit. He looks at something—or someone—just out of the frame.,"O : ""I'm so happy to have you near. You can’t imagine how much it means to me.""",He lies down. A small smile appears.
,"O : ""You know, I’d love to go see that movie with you. I think you might actually like it for real.""","He laughs a little, turning his head like he’s waiting for someone to answer.",A moment of silence.,,,
,"O : ""Hey... Can you get me a glass of water?""",No reply.,"The silence stays. But now, it feels different. A little heavier.","...",,
